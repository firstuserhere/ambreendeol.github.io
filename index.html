            <p>Hello! I'm Ambreen. I am originally from India and have trained extensively in the United States medical system.</p>

            <p>I've recently completed surgical rotations at Cleveland Clinic (Colorectal Surgery - Acting Internship), Mt Sinai (Thoracic Surgery), UAB (Thoracic Surgery), and Stanford (otolaryngology and head & neck surgery).</p>
            
            <p>I recently published a study on "<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00031348251337153" target="_blank">Assessment of Factors and Deterrents Influencing Medical Students in Pursuing a Career in Surgical Disciplines: Gender-Based Perceptions From a Teaching Hospital in India</a>" in The American Surgeon journal. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00031348251337153" target="_blank">DOI</a>)</p>
            
            <p>I write regularly about my medical experiences and insights on my blog, <a href="https://substack.com/@surgeondeol/notes" target="_blank">Surgeon Deol</a>.</p>
            
            <p>I'm an active mentor for aspiring medical professionals through my community, <a href="https://chat.whatsapp.com/Ibc41lYkdyr5qqZqUDaExR" target="_blank">First Assist</a>.</p>
            
            <p>You can find slides from various talks and presentations I've given <a href="talks.html">here</a>.</p>
            
            <p>When not in scrubs, I can be found hiking trails - check out my <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/83927421" target="_blank">Strava</a>!</p>
